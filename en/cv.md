## Research Activities

### Research Topic

AI weather forecasting using deep learning methods and related applications

### Research Overview

Conventional weather forecasting generally requires time-intensive physical simulations executed on large-scale supercomputing clusters. To address this limitation, I conduct research on high-speed, high-accuracy AI weather forecasting using deep learning methods with reduced computational cost.

In recent work, I have also investigated methods for analyzing meteorological factors relevant to weather control and estimating control inputs by leveraging adversarial attack techniques.

These studies are expected to contribute to improved AI weather prediction accuracy and to the advancement of weather control technologies.
